## Getting started by role

Whether you're a designer, technical lead, or product manager, this guide provides role-specific guidance to help you get started with Procore Connect.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="paintbrush" title="For Designers: Review UX patterns and components">
    Start by understanding the available UX patterns and how they can be integrated into your solution:
    
    1. **Review UX Recipes** - Explore the [six core collaboration patterns](/user-experience/recipes):
       - Send Copies of Internal Data
       - Link External Objects to Internal Objects
       - Engage with External Items
       - Create Copies of External Data
       - Monitor Status of Data Sent to Other Accounts
       - Retain External Data
    
    2. **Study UX Components** - Review reusable [components and patterns](/user-experience/components) that maintain consistency across solutions
    
    3. **Explore Examples** - See [real-world examples](/user-experience/examples) of how these patterns are implemented
    
    4. **Review Research** - Understand the [user research and validation](/user-experience/research) behind these patterns
    
    <Tip>Start with one pattern that solves your most critical customer pain point, then expand to additional patterns as needed.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="code" title="For Technical Leads: Review API capabilities">
    Understand the technical foundation and implementation requirements:
    
    1. **Review Core APIs** - Understand the three foundational APIs:
       - [Share API](/api-reference/user-api/introduction#1-share-api) - Share data between accounts
       - [Query API](/api-reference/user-api/introduction#2-query-api) - Query items across accounts
       - [Permissions API](/api-reference/user-api/introduction#3-permissions-api) - Verify sharing permissions
    
    2. **Explore Endpoints** - Review [UX Behavior Endpoints](/api-reference/introduction#ux-behavior-endpoints) that map to specific collaboration patterns
    
    3. **Review Implementation Guides** - Check [Engineering Overview](/engineering/overview) for front-end and back-end implementation guidance
    
    4. **Reference OpenAPI Spec** - Use the [OpenAPI specification](/api-reference/user-api-openapi.json) for complete endpoint documentation
    
    <Tip>Familiarize yourself with the API structure before planning implementation. The endpoints are organized by UX behavior, making it easier to map to your design patterns.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="clipboard-list" title="For Product Managers: Plan your integration">
    Create a clear plan for integrating Procore Connect into your solution:
    
    1. **Map customer needs to patterns** - Identify which [UX recipes](/user-experience/recipes) address your customer pain points
    
    2. **Prioritize implementation** - Start with the pattern that provides the most value with the least complexity
    
    3. **Define success metrics** - Establish how you'll measure impact:
       - Reduction in manual data entry
       - Time saved in cross-account workflows
       - Customer satisfaction improvements
       - Adoption rates of Procore Connect features
    
    4. **Plan phased rollout** - Consider implementing one pattern at a time, validate with customers, then expand
    
    5. **Review platform resources** - Check [Solution Coverage](/platform-resources/solution-coverage) and [Customer Impact](/platform-resources/customer-impact) for additional context
    
    <Tip>Work closely with your design and engineering leads to ensure the chosen patterns align with your solution's UX and technical architecture.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Before you begin

Before diving into implementation, ensure Procore Connect aligns with your team's strategic goals:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="list-check" title="Align with your roadmap priorities">
    Ensure Procore Connect aligns with your team's strategic goals:
    
    1. **Identify cross-account collaboration needs** in your solution
       - Where do your customers need to work with other Procore accounts?
       - What workflows break when customers must collaborate externally?
       - What customer pain points relate to cross-account scenarios?
    
    2. **Assess solution fit**
       - Does your solution enable workflows that require multiple Procore accounts?
       - Will Procore Connect capabilities address specific customer requests or support tickets?
       - Are there existing workarounds that Procore Connect could replace?
    
    3. **Prioritize use cases**
       - Review the [UX Recipes](/user-experience/recipes) to identify which patterns solve your customers' needs
       - Consider starting with one pattern (e.g., "Send Copies of Internal Data") before expanding
       - Align with product roadmap timelines and customer commitments
    
    <Warning>Don't implement Procore Connect just because it's available. Ensure it solves real customer problems that align with your roadmap.</Warning>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="users" title="Communicate with leadership">
    Before beginning implementation, ensure stakeholders understand the value and scope:
    
    **What to communicate:**
    - **Business value:** How Procore Connect addresses customer pain points and improves collaboration
    - **Solution scope:** Which Procore Connect patterns you plan to implement (review [UX Overview](/user-experience/overview) for options)
    - **Timeline and resources:** Estimated effort based on the patterns you're implementing
    - **Success metrics:** How you'll measure impact (reduced manual data entry, improved customer satisfaction, etc.)
    
    **Key talking points:**
    - Procore Connect is **not** a complete redesign — it complements existing experiences
    - It solves specific cross-account collaboration problems without changing core Procore workflows
    - Implementation is discrete and stable, making it easier to integrate into existing solutions
    
    **Recommended approach:**
    1. Schedule a brief stakeholder review to share your proposed Procore Connect integration
    2. Present a concise summary of the customer problem and how Procore Connect addresses it
    3. Show specific examples from the [UX Examples](/user-experience/examples) that match your use case
    4. Outline a phased approach if implementing multiple patterns
    
    <Tip>Reference the [Business Context](/business-context) section to ensure you're communicating the right scope — Procore Connect is focused, not a complete platform overhaul.</Tip>
