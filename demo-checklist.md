## Key Talking Points

### Problem Statement
- Teams spend days gathering context
- Information is fragmented across tools
- No clear starting point for different roles

### Solution Highlights
- **Organization**: Guides vs API Reference, role-based
- **Completeness**: Business + UX + Technical in one place
- **Actionability**: Ready-to-use patterns, not just reference
- **Accessibility**: Role-specific paths, clear navigation

### Value Proposition

- AI tools section

**Must Keep:**
- Navigation structure
- Quickstart overview
- One UX section example
- One API reference example
- Closing impact statement

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: How do teams find what they need?**
A: Role-based quickstart guides them immediately, then they can dive into their specific area (UX for designers, API for engineers, Business Context for PMs).

**Q: How is this different from Confluence/Wiki?**
A: It's organized by user journey and role, not just topic. Everything is structured to help teams get started quickly, not just reference later.

**Q: How do you keep it updated?**
A: Reusable snippets, OpenAPI integration for API docs, and clear structure make updates straightforward. AI tools help maintain consistency.

**Q: What about other tools they use?**
A: We've integrated AI tools (Cursor setup guide), and Mintlify provides contextual options to copy code, get AI assistance, and share directly from the docs.
