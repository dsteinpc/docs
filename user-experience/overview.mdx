Procore Connect's User Experience is focused on **eliminating the friction that occurs when two or more Procore customers need to work together.**

## The Fundamental Problem

When two or more Procore customers work together, they expect their accounts to talk to one another. Historically, because Procore accounts have not been connected to one another, reality does not meet this expectation. This is how most customer react when they learn this:


### Cross-Account Collaboration
Ultimately, these pain points occur while our users seek to solve fundamental tasks that require cross-account collaboration. Cross-Account Collaboration is our term for workflows, processes, and interactions that need to happen between Procore customers, rather than collaboration that occurs internally within a given company (which Procore has historically supported well.)

### Jobs-to-be-Done
These are the jobs to be done that our customers are fundamentally trying to accomplish.

### Broken Experience

In practice, when attempting to accomplish these jobs-to-be-done, the lack of account-to-account "connection" leads to a degraded experience:
> **Why can’t my Procore account talk to theirs?**

* Need to navigate between multiple Procore accounts and projects
* Establishment of a given customer's Procore account as the "primary" account from which everyone else will work (i.e., all other accounts, workflows, etc. become secondary)
* Silo'd data that's created within a given account but must be moved elsewhere in order to be processes by respective teams and workflow experts

### Pain Points

Here are the primary pain points that our customers currently experience when working with one another:
1. **Manual & Duplicative Data Entry:** Customers must find data in another account and move it to their own.
2. **Broken Workflows & Ownership:** Customers can’t follow their own processes & SOPs, putting the project at risk.
3. **Data Loss:** When a project ends, critical information is siloed in another customer’s account.
4. **Unclear Value:** Customers question paying for their own account when they’re not able to use it.


## Solutions

In the following sections, we'll provide you with validated recipes, components, examples, and other resources that **enable you to address these immediate pain points by complementing (rather than changing)** your existing experience and helping you to build toward seamless, consistent cross-account collaboration.

In summary, you can choose to use any or all of the following recipes to solve your cross-account collaboration problems:

<Card icon="database" href="/user-experience/recipes#retain-external-data">**Retain External Data**</Card>
</Columns>

When used individually or together, these solutions help create a **"good" experience** that eliminates the fundamental pain points highlighted above, while also serving as a **basis for "better" and even "ideal" experiences** to be developed in the future.
