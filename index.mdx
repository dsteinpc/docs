## Why Procore Connect?

Procore Connect unlocks our customers' inherent need to work effectively with one another. While Procore has uniquely changed how the construction industry works and collaborates, we've become a victim of our own success: as non-GC customers seek to purchase Procore for their own needs, our in-project, our historic, project-based collaboration model has broken down and failed to adapt to how our customers ideally need to work.

### ❌ Procore without Procore Connect

When two Procore customers need to work together, **their experience is degraded**:

* Forced to decide to use one Procore account as the "primary" account from which everyone else will work (i.e., all other accounts, workflows, etc. become secondary)
* Forced to navigate between multiple Procore accounts and projects
* Forced to manually upload, download, copy, and migrate data between accounts in order for it to be process by respective teams and workflow experts

This translates into signficant [pain points](/user-experience/overview#pain-points), including a fundamental business concern: 
> Why pay for Procore if the experience of working with other Procore accounts is so broken?

### ✅ Procore with Procore Connect

With Procore Connect, **customers have a better experience when they work with other Procore customers**:

* Every user gets their job done without leaving their account
* Data can be shared almost instantly across accounts
* Customers can quickly and securely collaborate externally and with their own teams
* Project risk decreases via high quality data, clear permissions, and customer-centric workflows
