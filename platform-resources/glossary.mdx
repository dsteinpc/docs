## Core Concepts

#### Cross-Account Collaboration

Workflows, processes, and interactions that need to happen between Procore customers, rather than collaboration that occurs internally within a given company. Cross-account collaboration enables stakeholders to track progress and manage collaborative work from their own environment, creating a single source of truth while maintaining data ownership and control.

#### Project-level Collaboration

Collaboration that occurs within a single project across different Procore accounts. This enables project stakeholders from different companies to work together on shared project work without leaving their own accounts.

#### Data Retention

An automated, read-only, and structured copy of finalized project data directly into a Procore account. Data Retention Platform 2.0 provides customers with permanent record-keeping capabilities, allowing them to keep records of accomplishments, protect their company in disputes, and use data for future planning, even when the data originated from another company.

#### Linked Items

Bidirectional links between external items (from another Procore account) and internal items (from your own account). Linked items maintain context and relationships, allowing users to include critical context in their work even when it's generated by another company. Links can be of different types including Reference, Related, Dependency, and Parent relationships.

#### Selective Sharing

A sharing configuration that provides users with granular control over what data is shared between connected accounts, rather than syncing everything by default. Selective sharing enables users to choose specific fields or components to share, giving them fine-grained control over data exchange.

## Connection Types

#### Point-to-Point Connection

A connection type that enables any project stakeholder to initiate flexible, bi-directional links between accounts. This eliminates double data entry and supports real-world project structures by allowing direct connections between specific accounts.

#### Connection Manager

A system that supports bidirectional data flows between connected accounts, enabling seamless collaboration. The Connection Manager provides directionality separation and configurations, allowing companies to adapt each tool direction to their company relationships rather than using generalizable directionality.

## Data Types

#### External Data / External Item

Data or items that originate from another Procore account. External data can be queried, linked to internal items, copied into your account, or retained for record-keeping.

#### Internal Data / Internal Item

Data or items that originate from your own Procore account. Internal data can be shared with external accounts, linked to external items, or used to create connections with other accounts.

## Sharing Types

#### Implicit Sharing

Automatic sharing based on predefined rules or configurations. This type of sharing occurs automatically without requiring manual user action.

#### Explicit Sharing

Manual sharing action initiated directly by a user. This type of sharing requires the user to explicitly choose to share data with another account.
