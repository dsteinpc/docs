# 3-Minute Procore Connect Documentation Demo Script

## Goal
Demonstrate how this documentation platform provides comprehensive context to engineering, design, and PM teams starting Procore Connect work, enabling them to get started quickly and effectively.

---

## Script

### [0:00-0:30] Opening Hook - The Problem We're Solving

**"When an engineer, designer, or PM needs to start working on a Procore Connect experience, they traditionally face a critical problem: fragmented context."**

*Show the home page*

- They have to hunt across multiple tools, docs, and conversations
- They lack clear understanding of business context, user needs, and technical implementation
- They spend days gathering context before they can even start building

**"What we've built changes that completely. This documentation platform gives them everything they need in one place, organized by how they actually work."**

---

### [0:30-2:30] Main Demo - The Solution

#### [0:30-0:45] Navigation & Structure
*Navigate through the sidebar*

**"Let me show you how this works. Notice the structure - we have Guides and API Reference as separate tabs, organized by how teams actually consume information."**

- **Guides tab**: For understanding, planning, and implementation
- **API Reference tab**: For technical implementation details
- **Role-based organization**: Content organized for PMs, Designers, and Engineers

*Click on "Getting Started" → "Quickstart"*

#### [0:45-1:15] Quickstart - Three-Step Process
*Scroll through the Quickstart page*

**"Here's the entry point - a three-step Quickstart that works for everyone. Notice how it's structured with accordions for progressive disclosure."**

*Expand an accordion*

**"Whether you're a PM, designer, or engineer, you get role-specific guidance right here. No more 'where do I start?' questions."**

*Show the role-based cards at the bottom*

**"And immediately, we give them next steps based on their role - User Experience for designers, API Reference for engineers, Implementation Guides for both."**

#### [1:15-1:45] User Experience Section - For Designers
*Navigate to User Experience → Overview*

**"For designers, we've created a complete UX resource center."**

*Show the pain points and solutions*

**"They understand the customer problem first, then see six validated recipes they can use."**

*Navigate to User Experience → Recipes*

**"Each recipe is a complete pattern with examples, components, and implementation guidance. Designers can see exactly how to implement cross-account collaboration in their solutions."**

*Navigate to User Experience → Components*

**"And here are reusable components that maintain consistency across all Procore Connect experiences."**

#### [1:45-2:15] API Reference - For Engineers
*Switch to API Reference tab*

**"For engineers, we have complete API documentation organized by UX behavior."**

*Show the Procore Connect Endpoints section*

**"Notice this is organized by what the user is trying to accomplish - 'Send Copies of Internal Data', 'Link External Objects' - not just by technical endpoints. This makes it intuitive to find the right API."**

*Click on an endpoint*

**"Each endpoint has complete documentation with request/response examples, parameters, error handling - everything they need to implement."**

*Show the OpenAPI spec link*

**"And we have the full OpenAPI specification for programmatic access."**

#### [2:15-2:30] Business Context & Platform Resources
*Navigate to Business Context → Overview*

**"But it's not just technical docs. We provide business context too."**

*Show the scope and goals*

**"PMs understand why Procore Connect exists, what problems it solves, and how to align with roadmap priorities."**

*Navigate to Platform Resources*

**"And we have platform resources - glossary, analytics, customer impact - all the context they need to make informed decisions."**

---

### [2:30-3:00] Closing - The Impact

**"So what does this mean for your teams?"**

*Return to home page*

**"Engineers, designers, and PMs now have:**
- **Complete context** in one place - business goals, user needs, technical implementation
- **Role-specific guidance** - they can find what they need for their role
- **Ready-to-use patterns** - validated UX recipes and components
- **Clear implementation paths** - from understanding to building

**"Instead of days of context gathering, they can start building in hours. They understand the 'why', the 'what', and the 'how' - all in one platform."**

*Show the contextual options in Mintlify*

**"And with Mintlify's contextual options, they can copy code, share links, and even get AI assistance directly from the docs - making it even easier to get started."**

**"This is how we improve context delivery and accelerate Procore Connect development across all solutions."**

## Key Features to Highlight (Choose Based on Time)

### Must Show:
1. ✅ Navigation structure (Guides vs API Reference)
2. ✅ Quickstart with role-based guidance
3. ✅ User Experience section (recipes, components)
4. ✅ API Reference organization by UX behavior
5. ✅ Business context section

### Nice to Show (If Time Permits):
- AI tools integration (Cursor setup)
- Reusable snippets
- OpenAPI spec integration
- Platform resources (glossary, analytics)
- Mintlify contextual options (copy, view, AI assistance)

---

## Demo Tips

1. **Start with the problem** - Always frame around the context gap teams face
2. **Show, don't tell** - Navigate through the actual docs, don't just describe
3. **Highlight the organization** - The structure is the key value proposition
4. **Emphasize role-specific paths** - Show how different roles find what they need
5. **End with impact** - Connect back to the goal: faster time-to-value for teams
