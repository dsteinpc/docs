## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

<Card
  title="Plant Store Endpoints"
  icon="leaf"
  href="https://github.com/mintlify/starter/blob/main/api-reference/openapi.json"
>
  View the OpenAPI specification file
</Card>

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP is enabled globally for all endpoints through the `x-mint` extension at the root level of the OpenAPI specification. You can selectively disable MCP for specific endpoints by adding the `x-mint` extension at the operation level.

### Global Configuration

Enable MCP for all endpoints by default:

```json
{
  "openapi": "3.1.0",
  "x-mint": {
    "mcp": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  },
  // ...
}
```

### Per-Endpoint Configuration

Disable MCP for a specific endpoint by overriding the global setting:

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "/plants/{id}": {
      "delete": {
        "x-mint": {
          "mcp": {
            "enabled": false
          }
        },
        // ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, MCP is enabled globally, but disabled for the `DELETE /plants/{id}` endpoint.

## Using MCP with AI Assistants

When MCP is enabled, your documentation automatically exposes an MCP server at `https://yourdocs.com/mcp`. This allows AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and Goose to:

- **Understand your API**: Read endpoint descriptions, parameters, and schemas
- **Generate code**: Create working examples in multiple programming languages
- **Answer questions**: Provide accurate information about your API
- **Help users**: Guide developers through API interactions

### Connecting to the MCP Server

To use MCP with your AI assistant:

1. **Find your MCP server URL**: Your documentation's MCP server is available at `https://yourdocs.com/mcp`
2. **Configure your AI client**: Add the MCP server URL to your AI assistant's configuration
3. **Start asking questions**: Ask natural language questions about your API endpoints

### Example Questions

With MCP enabled, you can ask your AI assistant:
- "How do I fetch all plants?"
- "What parameters does the GET /plants endpoint accept?"
- "Show me how to create a new plant using curl"
- "What's the schema for a Plant object?"

The AI assistant will use the MCP tools to access your OpenAPI specification and provide accurate, up-to-date answers.

## Using MCP in Your Development Project

As an engineer working in another project, you can connect Cursor to the MCP server to access your API documentation directly from your codebase. This enables AI-assisted development with real-time access to endpoint specifications.

### Step 1: Configure Cursor with MCP Server

In your development project (not the docs repository), you can set up the MCP connection using the Mintlify CLI or manually.

#### Option A: Using Mintlify CLI (Recommended)

The easiest way is to use the Mintlify MCP CLI tool:

```bash
npx mint-mcp add <your-subdomain-or-domain>
```

Replace `<your-subdomain-or-domain>` with your Mintlify documentation's subdomain or domain (e.g., `docs.yourcompany.com` or `yourcompany.mintlify.app`).

This command automatically:
- Generates the MCP server configuration
- Adds it to your Cursor settings
- Sets up the connection to your documentation's MCP endpoint

#### Option B: Manual Configuration

Alternatively, you can manually configure the MCP server:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="macOS/Linux">

Create or update `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "your-docs": {
      "url": "https://yourdocs.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows">

Create or update `%APPDATA%\Cursor\mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "your-docs": {
      "url": "https://yourdocs.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
Replace `https://yourdocs.com/mcp` with your actual documentation URL. The MCP server is automatically available at `/mcp` on your published documentation site.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Verify Connection

After configuring the MCP server:

1. **Restart Cursor** to load the connection
2. **Open Cursor Settings** → Navigate to the MCP section
3. **Verify** that your documentation's MCP server is listed and enabled

You should see your documentation server in the list of available MCP servers.

### Step 3: Use MCP in Your Code

Once connected, Cursor can access your API documentation and help you work with the endpoints. Cursor will automatically use the MCP server when you ask questions about your API.

<Tip>
You don't need a special prefix or command. Simply ask Cursor questions about your API endpoints, and it will automatically query the MCP server to get accurate information from your OpenAPI specification.
</Tip>

Here are practical examples:

#### Example 1: Generate API Client Code

In your project, ask Cursor:

```
Create a TypeScript client for the Plant Store API that includes:
- A function to fetch all plants with optional limit parameter
- A function to create a new plant
- Proper error handling and TypeScript types
```

Cursor will use the MCP server to:
- Read the OpenAPI specification for your endpoints
- Understand request/response schemas
- Generate type-safe client code matching your API

#### Example 2: Get Endpoint Details

While writing code, ask Cursor:

```
What are the required fields for creating a plant? Show me the request body schema.
```

Cursor will query the MCP server and provide:
- Exact field requirements from the OpenAPI spec
- Data types and validation rules
- Example request bodies

#### Example 3: Generate Integration Code

Ask Cursor:

```
I need to fetch plants and display them in a React component. 
Generate the code using the GET /plants endpoint.
```

Cursor will:
- Understand the endpoint structure via MCP
- Generate React component code with proper data fetching
- Include error handling based on the API spec

#### Example 4: Debug API Issues

When troubleshooting, ask Cursor:

```
The POST /plants endpoint is returning a 400 error. 
What could be wrong based on the API specification?
```

Cursor will:
- Check the endpoint schema via MCP
- Identify required fields and validation rules
- Suggest specific fixes based on the actual API spec

### Example Workflow

Here's a complete example of using MCP in a development workflow:

**1. Starting a new feature that uses the API:**

```typescript
// In your project file
// Ask Cursor: "Show me how to fetch plants with pagination"

// Cursor generates code using MCP to understand the API:
async function fetchPlants(limit?: number) {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/plants?limit=' + (limit || 10), {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.API_KEY}`
    }
  });
  
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`API error: ${response.status}`);
  }
  
  return response.json();
}
```

**2. Creating a new resource:**

```typescript
// Ask Cursor: "Create a function to add a new plant with the correct schema"

// Cursor uses MCP to get the exact schema:
interface NewPlant {
  name: string;  // Required
  tag?: string;  // Optional
  id: number;    // Required
}

async function createPlant(plant: NewPlant) {
  // Implementation generated from MCP schema
}
```

### Benefits of Using MCP in Development

- **Always up-to-date**: Cursor reads directly from your published OpenAPI spec
- **Type safety**: Generate TypeScript types that match your actual API
- **Error prevention**: Cursor knows which fields are required and their types
- **No context switching**: Access API docs without leaving your editor
- **Accurate examples**: Code examples are generated from your actual API specification

### Troubleshooting

<Warning>
**MCP server not found**: Ensure your documentation is published and accessible. The MCP server is only available on published documentation sites, not local previews.
</Warning>

If you're having connection issues:

1. Verify the MCP server URL is correct: `https://yourdocs.com/mcp`
2. Check that your documentation site is live and accessible
3. Ensure MCP is enabled in your OpenAPI specification
4. Restart Cursor after configuration changes

### Next Steps

- Try asking Cursor about specific endpoints in your project
- Generate API clients for different languages
- Use MCP to understand webhook payloads and set up handlers
- Create integration tests based on the API specification
