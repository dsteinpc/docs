## API Features

### 1. Share API
The core of the collaboration experience is centered around two parties sharing data with each other. This is a point-in-time action, intentionally abstracted from implementation details.

**Share Types:**
- **Implicit** - Automatic sharing based on predefined rules
- **Explicit** - Manual sharing action initiated by user

**Request Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `sourceProjectId` | string | ID of the source project sharing the data |
| `targetProjectId` | string | ID of the target project receiving the data |
| `itemId` | string | ID of the item being shared |
| `type` | enum | Implicit or Explicit |
| `metadata` | object | Additional metadata for the share operation |

### 2. Query API
Query specific items within Procore's ecosystem and retrieve all available attribute fields. Supports multiple item types including RFIs, Drawings, Submittals, and more.

**Query Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `itemId` | string | Unique item identifier |
| `type` | string | Type of item (RFI, Drawing, etc.) |
| `vendorId` | string | Vendor identifier |

### 3. Permissions API
Before data is shared, verify that the action is permissible. This validates user permissions in the context of specific projects.

**Permission Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `userId` | long | User identifier |
| `projectId` | string | Project identifier |

## Authentication

Currently, this API does not require authentication. All endpoints are publicly accessible.

<Warning>
  This is a demonstration API. In production, you should implement proper authentication and authorization.
</Warning>

## Data Storage

The API uses in-memory storage, meaning all data is stored in RAM and will be lost when the server restarts. This is suitable for development and testing purposes.

<Note>
  For production use, integrate a persistent database like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or MySQL.
</Note>

## Error Handling

The API returns standard HTTP status codes:

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `200` | Success |
| `201` | Created |
| `400` | Bad Request (validation errors) |
| `403` | Forbidden (permission denied) |
| `404` | Not Found |
| `500` | Internal Server Error |

All error responses follow this format:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message describing what went wrong"
}
```

All successful responses include:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... }
}
```
