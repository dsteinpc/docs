## MCP Capabilities

<Info>
This endpoint is enabled for Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing AI assistants to interact with your API directly.
</Info>

### What MCP enables

With MCP enabled for this endpoint, AI assistants can:

- **Query plant data**: Automatically retrieve plant information when users ask questions
- **Generate code examples**: Create working code snippets in multiple languages
- **Answer questions**: Provide accurate responses about available plants and their properties
- **Filter and search**: Help users find specific plants based on criteria

### Example AI interactions

When users ask questions like:
- "What plants are available in the store?"
- "Show me the first 5 plants"
- "How do I fetch plants using JavaScript?"

The AI assistant can use this endpoint via MCP to provide real-time, accurate responses with code examples.

### Try it yourself

Connect an AI assistant (like Claude, Cursor, or Goose) to your documentation's MCP server at `https://yourdocs.com/mcp` and ask it to interact with this endpoint!
