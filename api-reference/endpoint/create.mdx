</Info>

### What MCP enables

With MCP enabled for this endpoint, AI assistants can:

- **Create plants automatically**: Generate the correct request body based on user descriptions
- **Validate data**: Ensure required fields are included before making requests
- **Generate code**: Provide complete, ready-to-use code examples for creating plants
- **Handle errors**: Understand error responses and suggest fixes

### Example AI interactions

Users can ask the AI assistant:
- "Create a new plant called 'Rose' with tag 'flower'"
- "Show me how to add a plant using Python"
- "What fields do I need to create a plant?"

The AI assistant will use this endpoint via MCP to:
1. Understand the required schema from the OpenAPI spec
2. Generate the correct request format
3. Provide working code examples
4. Help troubleshoot any issues

### Try it yourself

Connect your AI assistant to the MCP server and ask it to create a plant for you!
