<Warning>
This endpoint has MCP disabled to prevent accidental deletions through AI assistant interactions.
</Warning>

## Why MCP is disabled

MCP is explicitly disabled for this endpoint (`x-mint.mcp.enabled: false`) as a safety measure. This prevents AI assistants from:

- Automatically executing delete operations
- Suggesting destructive actions without user confirmation
- Creating workflows that could accidentally remove data

### When to disable MCP

Consider disabling MCP for endpoints that:
- Perform destructive operations (DELETE, irreversible updates)
- Handle sensitive data or operations
- Require additional security verification
- Should not be executed automatically by AI assistants

### Manual usage

This endpoint can still be used normally through direct API calls, but AI assistants will not have automatic access to it via MCP.
