## Vision

Our vision is to evolve Procore into a 'connectable' Platform so all users can complete everything in their own account. This strongly aligns with our mission to connect everyone in construction on a single platform. Customers will have capabilities to easily work with people outside of their company right from their own Procore account and not have to manually move data across accounts.

## What Procore Offers?

### Cross Account Collaboration MVP
Enables all stakeholders to track progress and manage collaborative work from their own environment, creating a single source of truth.

### Cross Account Collaboration - Connection Manager
Connection Manager needs to support bidirectional data flows, enabling seamless collaboration between connected accounts.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Directionality Separation & Configurations**: Allows our customers to stray away from generalizable directionality in connection manager and allow companies to adapt each tool direction to their company relationships
- Bidirectional data synchronization
- Flexible configuration options

### Data Retention Platform 2.0
Provides an automated, read-only, and structured copy of finalized project data directly into their own Procore account. For our internal Tool Teams, it provides an improved, modern architecture that is modular, supported by clear documentation.

### Selective Sharing
Enabling different types of sharing configurations provides users with granular control over what data is shared between connected accounts, rather than syncing everything by default.

### Connected Vendor (Private Sharing) - MVP
Allows us to sync private and participating data with the relevant receiving company, ensuring that vendors only see information pertinent to their work.

### Support for Custom Fieldsets and Custom Fields
This feature will enable the mapping, synchronization, and display of Custom Fields and Fieldsets within all cross-account workflows, preserving company-specific data structures.

### Point-to-Point Connection
Enables any project stakeholder to initiate flexible, bi-directional links between accounts, eliminating double data entry and supporting real-world project structures.

### Connect Design System
A developer portal asset for accelerating adoption, ensuring consistency, and scaling the Procore Connect ecosystem for internal partner teams.

1. **Enhance Collaboration**: Enable seamless data sharing across organizational boundaries
