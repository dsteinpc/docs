While Procore Connect can feel daunting and complex, it can be helpful to scope and limit the project to realize that we're actually solving very specific needs.

First, let's start by understanding whtat Procore Connect is *not*:

## Procore Connect is not...

- **Not** a reshaping of tools, experiences, or user behaviors
- **Not** a re-imagining of Procore's architecture or mental model
- **Not** an attempt to build live collaboration or shared experiences (like Google Docs)
- **Not** a reinvention or complication of Procore's permission model

## Procore Connect is...

Now that we've gotten some of the largest and scariest possible alternatives out-of-the-way, let's identify what Procore Connect is:

1. A means of enabling new interactions **across Procore accounts** (rather than intra-account collaboration, which Procore already supports well). We specifically refer to this new capabiltiy as **Cross-Account Collaboration**
2. An effort to ensure a high-quality, consistent, and performant user experiences and corresponding techncial capabilities
3. An effort to ensure that implementation of those experiences and capabilities are discrete, stable, and easy to impelment for our colleagues on tool and solution teams.
